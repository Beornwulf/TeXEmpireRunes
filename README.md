TeXEmpireRunes
==============

A LaTeX package to easily use the runes from Empire LARP in text.

To use, place empirerunes.sty and Wintermark-Regular.ttf in the same folder as your .tex file(s). You can either use the command \rune{a} or \aesh to create the Aesh rune, and so forth for the other runes.

Requires XeLaTeX to run, due to use of the fontspec package.

Full documentation will be forthcoming. Contributions welcome.

The runes are from http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Rune_Overview and belong to Profound Decisions.
